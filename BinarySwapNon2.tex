%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
  A key component of most large-scale rendering systems is binary swap, a parallel image compositing algorithm, or a variant of it.
  Although shown to be very efficient, one of the classic limitations of binary swap is that it only works on a number of processes that is a perfect power of 2.
  Multiple variations of binary swap have been independently introduced to overcome this limitation and handle process counts that have factors that are not 2.
  To date, few of these approaches have been directly compared against each other, making it unclear which approach is best.
  This paper presents a fresh implementation of each of these methods using a common software framework to make them directly comparable.
  These methods to run binary swap with odd factors, plus one more introduced in this paper, are directly compared.
  The results show that some simple compositing approaches work as well or better than more complex algorithms that are more difficult to implement.

Parallel rendering is critical for large-scale scientific visualization.
Broadly speaking, there are two general approaches to render data in a distributed parallel system.
The first approach is to distribute the geometry such that each process can completely render a subregion of the screen (known as \keyterm{sort-first} rendering\lcite{Molnar1994}).
The second approach is to have each process render a full image with partial data and then combine (a.k.a. composite or reduce) these to a single, complete image (known as \keyterm{sort-last} rendering\lcite{Molnar1994}).
It has long been shown that for large parallel jobs, sort-last provides much better scalability\lcite{Wylie2001}.
The efficiency of sort-last parallel rendering with image compositing has been demonstrated in many systems\lcite{Childs2010,Moreland2011:SC,Peterka2009:ICPP,Peterka2013}.

The efficiency of sort-last parallel rendering depends on the ability to composite the images generated by each process into a single image.
One of the most well known algorithms, and one still use commonly to date, is binary swap\lcite{BinarySwap2}.
Binary swap is popular because it is straightforward to implement and has good scaling behavior in terms of data transfer and number of iterations\fix{cite}.

One natural problem with binary swap is that because it iteratively divides processors into two groups, and these groups need to be the same size, it only works well when the number of processes is a perfect power of 2.
Multiple variations of binary swap have been independently introduced to overcome this limitation, but few have previously been directly compared with each other.
This paper reviews these existing approaches and introduces a new one.
It then describes a miniature rendering application built to easily implement these algorithms and provides the results of comparing these algorithms with each other.
